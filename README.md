## Book Recommendation with NLP
In the age of information overload, finding the right book to read can be overwhelming for readers faced with countless choices. Traditional recommendation systems often rely on user ratings or predefined genres, which can be limiting and fail to capture the nuances of individual preferences. Natural Language Processing (NLP), a subfield of artificial intelligence focused on the interaction between computers and human language, offers a powerful solution to this challenge.

By leveraging NLP techniques, a book recommendation system can go beyond surface-level data and analyze the actual content of books, summaries, reviews, and user feedback. This allows the system to understand themes, sentiments, writing styles, and user interests in a more sophisticated and personalized way. Whether it's matching a reader’s current mood, preferred writing tone, or thematic interests, an NLP-driven recommendation engine can offer deeper insights and more accurate suggestions.

This project aims to design and implement a book recommendation system using NLP methods such as text vectorization, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and similarity scoring. The goal is to enhance the reader’s experience by providing meaningful, content-aware book suggestions that evolve with their preferences over time.
